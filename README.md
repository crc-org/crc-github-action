# CRC GitHub Action

The CRC GitHub Action is a custom GitHub Action designed to integrate CRC into your CI/CD workflows.
This action facilitates the setup, start, and management of CRC instances directly within your GitHub
Actions pipelines, enabling seamless testing and development of your workload on OpenShift/MicroShift.

> [!NOTE]
> You are advised to maximize available diskspace using a third-party action.


## Features

- **Automated CRC Setup**: Installs and configures CRC on the runner.
- **Cluster Management**: Starts CRC cluster.
- **Environment Configuration**: Sets up necessary environment variables for cluster access.

## Usage

To incorporate the CRC GitHub Action into your workflow, include the following steps in your GitHub Actions YAML file:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up CRC
        uses: crc-org/crc-github-action@v1
        with:
          pull-secret: ${{ secrets.CRC_PULL_SECRET }}
          preset: openshift/microshift/okd (default is microshift)
          memory: <In MiB, if you want to change from default>
          cpus: < int, if you want to change from default>
          disk: <In GiB, if you want to change from default>

      # Additional steps for your workflow
```
